# Workshop 1

You will work in groups in the workshop.
One person in each group will press the "fork" button to create their own copy of the workspace.
They will then share the link with their group mates so everyone can edit the same code live.

PLEASE DON'T HIDE AT THE BACK!! :)

First activity is to get warmed up collaborating online.
Between the ===s below, each group member please write your preferred name, followed by the top reason why you already love functional programming.

Next, you will complete the exercises in `reduce.js`, `rects.js` and `conslists.js`, in that order.
Open `reduce.html`, `rects.html` and `conslists.html` to see the results of tests.
In the ed workspace you can do this by right clicking on the file and choosing "Open in Web Preview".
