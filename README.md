# FIT2102: Programming Paradigms
This is my course work for this unit, it uses Jupyter notebooks with the Deno kernel to allow code-execution for JS, TS and RxJS.

To install the Deno kernel, first you must have Deno installed.
> Official Deno Installation Docs: https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/

Now you can run this command to install the Deno kernel: \
`deno jupyter --unstable --install`
